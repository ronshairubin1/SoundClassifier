CARDINAL RULES FOR AI CODING HELPERS

1. DO NOT TAKE AWAY ANY EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY 
FROM THE EXISTING CODE UNLESS YOU ARE RECREATING 
IT FULLY IN THE ENTIRE CODEBASE. 
2. ALL CHANGES SHOULD BE MINIMALIST. 
3. ALL CHANGES SHOULD BE EXPLAINED IN DETAIL. 
IF THE NUMBER OF LINES DELETED IS MORE THAN 10% 
OF THE NUMBER OF LINES ADDED, DO NOT MAKE THE
