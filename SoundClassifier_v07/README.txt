Below is a high-level roadmap for building a single-syllable (or short-phoneme) classification system, along with recommendations on model architectures, open-source tooling, and strategies to avoid overfitting. While there‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all answer, these guidelines will help you get started and iterate.

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
1.1. Dataset Size
You mentioned having between 20‚Äì50 recordings per phoneme/sound and up to 100 different sounds. That might be as few as 2,000 total samples on the low end. This is fairly small for a deep learning model.
Increasing your dataset‚Äîeven slightly‚Äîwill help substantially. If possible, push for 50+ recordings per sound.
If new data is difficult to collect, use data augmentation extensively (see Section 2).
1.2. Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
Mel-Spectrograms: Convert each audio clip (e.g., 0.5‚Äì1.5 sec) into a mel-spectrogram. Libraries like librosa (Python) or torchaudio can compute these easily.
MFCCs: Using 12 or 13 MFCCs plus deltas and delta-deltas is a common approach. However, MFCC-only can overfit if the model is too large or the data is too small. Often, raw mel-spectrograms can be more robust when fed to a small convolutional network.
Normalization:
Normalize audio amplitude (peak or RMS normalization).
Standardize features (mean=0, std=1) if using MFCCs or mel-spectrograms.
1.3. Segmentation
You‚Äôre dealing with very short sounds (single syllables, phonemes). Consistency in trimming/silence removal is crucial:
Crop leading/trailing silences so that each sample is centered around the phoneme.
Use a fixed duration (e.g., 1 second) and zero-pad or clip to that length.
2. Data Augmentation
When you have a small dataset, data augmentation can help reduce overfitting:

Time Shift / Padding: Randomly shift the audio in time by a few milliseconds; pad the edges.
Add Noise: Add low-level white noise, or background noise at various SNR levels.
Pitch Shifting: Slight pitch shifts (though for phoneme classification this must be subtle, so as not to distort the key frequencies too much).
Time Stretching: Slightly speed up or slow down the audio (e.g., ¬±5% to 10%).
Equalization / Filter Effects: Apply random filters or EQ changes to simulate different microphone and room conditions.
These augmentations can be done in real-time during training (e.g., via a custom PyTorch DataLoader or Keras generator) or preprocessed offline.

3. Model Architecture
3.1. Small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Given there is no context needed beyond a short window, large transformer-based architectures are usually not beneficial‚Äîand often overkill‚Äîfor single-syllable classification.

2D CNN on Mel-Spectrograms: Treat each spectrogram as an ‚Äúimage.‚Äù A small CNN (e.g., 2‚Äì3 convolutional layers + pooling + 1 or 2 dense layers) can work well.
Batch Normalization: Incorporate batch norm after each convolution to help generalize.
Dropout: Use moderate dropout (e.g., 0.2‚Äì0.5) in fully connected layers to reduce overfitting.
A reference architecture (in pseudo-code) might look like:

python
Copy code
model = Sequential()
model.add(Conv2D(filters=16, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(freq_bins, time_frames, 1)))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.3))

model.add(Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3, 3), activation='relu'))
model.add(BatchNormalization())
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.3))

model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.3))
model.add(Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))
num_classes = number of phonemes/sounds.
freq_bins and time_frames depend on your mel-spectrogram parameters.
3.2. Simpler Models (Classical ML)
With very limited data, sometimes a well-tuned classic machine learning model (e.g. SVM, Random Forest) on top of MFCCs (or mel-frequency features) can outperform deep CNNs. If your CNN is overfitting badly, it‚Äôs worth trying:

SVM with an RBF kernel, grid-searching over C and 
ùõæ
Œ≥.
Random Forest or Gradient Boosting with controlled max depth.
Lightweight MLP with 1‚Äì2 hidden layers (like 32‚Äì64 units).
You can still do data augmentation and feed augmented features (MFCCs or spectral features) into these classical models.

3.3. Regularization to Avoid Overfitting
L2 Weight Decay: Add a small weight decay (e.g., 
1
ùëí
‚àí
4
1e‚àí4).
Early Stopping: Monitor validation accuracy/loss, stop training if it plateaus.
Dropout: Already mentioned, but crucial with small data.
4. Training Strategy
Train/Validation Split: With small data, carefully create a validation set. Perhaps do a K-fold cross-validation (e.g., 5-fold) so that each sample is used for training and validation in turns.
Learning Rate Scheduling: Use a moderately low initial learning rate (like 1e-3), and reduce on plateau if using an optimizer like Adam.
Evaluation Metrics: Use accuracy or F1-score, but also keep an eye on confusion matrices to see if certain phonemes get systematically confused.
5. Open-Source Frameworks & Libraries
Below are some libraries and frameworks you could leverage or extend:

SpeechBrain (PyTorch-based)

Modular speech toolkit for speech recognition, speaker identification, etc.
Can be adapted to small-scale classification tasks by writing a custom recipe.
Offers built-in data augmentation, feature extraction, and training loops.
ESPnet

Another end-to-end speech processing toolkit with strong emphasis on speech recognition and TTS.
Could be heavy if you only need a simple classification, but still possible to adapt.
TensorFlow Audio Classifier Examples

TensorFlow has tutorials using the AudioClassifier API with Model Maker.
You can adapt their examples for custom keywords or short sounds.
PyTorch + torchaudio

Very flexible for building custom pipelines.
Good for real-time data augmentation using transforms like torchaudio.transforms.FrequencyMasking, TimeMasking, etc.
Hugging Face Transformers & Datasets

While Transformers (like Wav2Vec2) might be overkill for single-syllable classification, Hugging Face‚Äôs datasets library can help manage data.
If you do try a Transformer-based approach for experimentation, you can fine-tune Wav2Vec2 on your set. However, this might overfit quickly with so few samples.
[Open-Source Example Projects on GitHub]

Search for ‚Äúaudio classification‚Äù or ‚Äúkeyword spotting.‚Äù People have posted minimal CNN-based keyword spotting projects, which you can adapt.
6. Putting It All Together
Suggested Approach (step by step):

Collect & Label Data: Aim for at least 20‚Äì50 samples per phoneme.
Augment: Apply time shift, add noise, pitch/time stretch.
Generate Spectrograms: Convert each audio clip into mel-spectrogram images (or keep them in memory as tensors).
Build a Small CNN:
2‚Äì3 convolutional layers, each followed by batch norm, pooling, and dropout.
Flatten, then 1‚Äì2 dense layers, final classification layer with softmax.
Regularize: Use dropout, L2, early stopping.
Validate: Use K-fold cross-validation or a hold-out set. Look at confusion matrices to debug.
Deploy: Once you have a robust model, you can also optimize it (e.g., to TensorFlow Lite) if you plan on using it in a real-time or mobile setting.
7. Additional Tips for Speech Therapy Use-Case
Feedback Mechanism: In a real speech therapy application, you‚Äôll likely want immediate feedback. For instance, if a user says ‚Äúee,‚Äù the model returns a confidence score or a ‚Äúcorrect/incorrect‚Äù classification.
Visualizations: Some systems display a spectrogram or a ‚Äúscore bar‚Äù in real time to motivate the user.
Customizing: You may want to adapt the system for each user with speech disorders. Fine-tuning on the user‚Äôs own voice can greatly improve accuracy (speaker adaptation).
Final Thoughts
A small CNN or a compact classical ML approach (like an SVM) on top of MFCCs/mel-spectrograms is typically best for short, context-independent phoneme classification. The biggest challenge is your limited data, so concentrate your efforts on data augmentation and robust regularization to reduce overfitting. Tools like SpeechBrain, PyTorch (with torchaudio), and TensorFlow (with built-in audio classification tutorials) provide an excellent starting point.

With a careful approach and enough iteration, you can build a reliable phoneme classification system to help users with speech disorders practice and improve their pronunciation. Good luck!
